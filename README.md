# voormeerwaarde-learning-projects

This repository is a collection of projects that were done preparing for the job at Voormeerwaarde where I was originally hired for, before being part of their other company WebA11y.

Each folder is a separate challenge from [front-end mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
The challenges are done in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Those files are located in the code folder of each challenge.
